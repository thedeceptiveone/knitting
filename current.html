  <h2>Willow Shawl/Scarf/Hood</h2>
  <p>After watching the Willow TV show, I had to know how what was going on with the shawl/scarf/hood combo the cook was wearing. So, I found a pattern on a blog: <a href="https://craftyrunnermom.blogspot.com/2022/12/free-knitting-pattern-willow-disney-tv.html?m=1" alt="Crafty Runner Mom Blog">Crafty Runner Mom</a>. If you have not seen the show and plan to, don't follow the link, there is a spoiler in there. Crafty Runner Mom provides a pattern with different sizing tips. I chose to split mine between two colors, pictured below. I am almost finished with the project, I just need to sew the hood together and onto the top.</p>
