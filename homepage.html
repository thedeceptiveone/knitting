    <p>I'm Katie Flisk. I learned how to knit in the girl scouts when I was about 10 years old. My mother and grandmother are both consistent knitters. I almost always have a project but normally take a long time to finish them. I like to learn new techniques but get bored if I work on the same thing.</p>
    <p>This site shows my current project, some past projects, and my core collection project. I have been working on a top all year from the TV series Willow. In the past I have knit toys for my nieces and nephew, hats, gloves, and baby blankets. I am working towards my Masters in Library Science and the core collection is a list of 12 items I researched and think belong in a knitting collection.</p>
