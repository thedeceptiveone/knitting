            <p class="paper">The knitting collection at the Wasilla Public Library is being revamped following the start of a knitting club that meets at the library once a month. The mission statement from the Wasilla Public Library website is:</p>
            <p class="paper quote">Set in the beautiful Matanuska-Susitna Valley, Wasilla Public Library is open to residents and visitors alike. The library contributes to building a sense of community and provides opportunities for improving quality of life by providing access to a broad range of resources designed to meet the educational, professional, intellectual, cultural and recreational needs of the area's diverse, rapidly growing population.</p>
            <p class="paper">The new knitting collection will meet the recreational and professional needs of the local community by providing them with resources. The patrons will gain access to instructional books, magazines, and a plethora of videos from Craftsy.com. The cost breakdown follows in Table 1.</p>

            <h4>Selection Criteria</h4>
            <p class ="paper">Items were chosen following the guidelines in the WPL collections development policy:</p>
            <ol class="quote">
              <li>The author’s reputation and significance as a writer.</li>
              <li>The importance of subject matter to the collection.</li>
              <li>Availability of material in other libraries or in print.</li>
              <li>Timeliness or permanence of the book.</li>
              <li>Authoritativeness.</li>
              <li>Inclusion in standard bibliographies or indexes.</li>
              <li>Price.</li>
              <li>Demand.</li>
              <li>Format, including quality of binding, type, legibility and illustrations.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="paper">Although each item did not meet every criterion, this list is intended as an aid to collection decision-making, and not all are required. Selection decisions were made through consulting various knitting blogs and websites for favorite books and magazines, then looking through professional reviews of the items that were found on multiple sites. Knitting can be applied to various clothing and toys, so the collection was broadened to ensure it included the most common uses – baby knits, gloves, hats, scarves, shawls, socks, and sweaters. There are also styles of knitting from different regions of the world and the collection shows that diversity. The knitting club could attract both beginner and experienced knitters, so the collection includes books catering to a wide range of skills.</p>
            <p class="paper">Formats were chosen based on availability and likely use. The Alaska Digital Library consortium, which WPL is a part of, pays a flat fee for Overdrive magazine subscriptions annually. This catalog includes seven knitting magazines plus specials. So, the WPL should not pay separately for digital magazine subscriptions. Based on usage statistics, there is demand for both print and ebooks, but ebooks are circulated less frequently. Also, according to Rothschild (2020), ebooks cost, on average, 3.5 times more for libraries, and that upcharge is reflected for those ebooks that did not have library pricing data readily available. Ebooks were chosen when hardback copies were unavailable.</p>
            <h4>WPL Core Knitting Collection</h4>
            <h5>Print Books:</h5>
            <p class="paper apa">Bliss, D. (2015). The knitter’s book of knowledge: A complete guide to essential knitting techniques (Illustrated edition). Union Square & Co.</p>
            <p class="paper quote">Bliss is experienced at creating hand-knit patterns and has written multiple books on the topic. She brings that knowledge to this reference book. Bliss covers casting on, knitting variations, designs, troubleshooting, and everything in between with illustrations to guide the reader.</p>
            <p class="paper quote">This instructional work is necessary for new knitters to learn the basics and can be used by experienced knitters to improve their craft as well.</p>
            <p class="paper apa">Budd, A. (2004). The knitter's handy book of sweater patterns: Basic designs in multiple sizes & gauges. Interweave.</p>
            <p class="paper quote">Budd’s book covers different types of sweaters with 15 sizes and five gauges provided for each. It also includes a chapter on adjusting the patterns for body measurements and gauges outside of the templates</p>
            <p class="paper quote">The WPL collection would benefit from the inclusion of this book because the patterns are simple for beginner knitters and can be adjusted by advanced knitters for additional colors. This is a good instructional book for knitting sweaters.</p>
            <p class="paper apa">Bush, N. (2010). Knitted lace of Estonia: Techniques, patterns, and traditions. Interweave Press.</p>
            <p class="paper quote">Bush gives an overview of the history of Estonian lace knitting and follows it with historic and contemporary shawl designs. The patterns are very elegant and Bush gives a walkthrough of how to accomplish them.</p>
            <p class="paper quote">This guide fills the lace knitting hole in the collection and includes beautiful shawl patterns. Unfortunately, it is unavailable in hardback or ebook format.</p>
            <p class="paper apa">Linvik, J. (2017). Jorid Linvik's Big Book of Knitted Socks: 45 Distinctive Scandinavian Patterns. Trafalgar Square Books.</p>

            <p class="paper quote">Linvik’s patterns are unique and show how to make socks for all ages. This is a great book for sock making-beginners and veterans.</p>
            <p class="paper apa">Olsson, C. (2023). Fair Isle Knitting: 22 Traditional Patterns from Where the Atlantic Meets the North Sea. Trafalgar Square.</p>
            <p class="paper quote">Olsson details the history and technique of Fair Isle knitting. Focused on advanced knitters, the book includes patterns for sweaters and accessories in the classic style. </p>
            <p class="paper quote">Fair Isle is a popular knitting style. Including this book would showcase the knitting history and patterns of the Shetland Islands.</p>
            <p class="paper apa">Parkes, C. (2007). The knitter's book of yarn: The ultimate guide to choosing, using, and enjoying yarn. Potter Craft.</p>
            <p class="paper quote">Parke’s book is a yarn guide, showing which type of yarn works for different projects. She uses her experience as a knitter and researcher to dive deep into the story of each type of yarn and what it is best suited for. She includes patterns to emphasize the uniqueness of different skeins so you can use your new knowledge immediately.</p>
            <p class="paper quote">Yarn is a necessary part of any knitting endeavor, so this guide is a must-have for experienced and new knitters alike.</p>
            <p class="paper apa">Rangel, A. (2017). Alterknit stitch dictionary: 200 modern knitting motifs. Krause Craft.</p>

There are instructional pages on colorwork theory so knitters without prior knowledge can learn the fundamentals of working with multiple colors.</p>
            <p class="paper quote">With its inclusion of colorwork principles and 200 designs from bees to geometric patterns, experienced knitters from the WPL community will enjoy this addition.</p>
            <p class="paper apa">Vogue Knitting Magazine (Ed.). (2018). Vogue knitting: The ultimate knitting book; Completely revised & updated. (Revised ed.). Sixth&Spring Books.</p>
            <p class="paper quote">This revised edition of Vogue Knitting added design techniques for shawls, sweaters, and accessories and has a chapter dedicated to each. Its organization makes it welcoming to readers seeking to learn new techniques including cables, directional knitting, and more. It also includes professional design secrets from the editors.</p>
            <p class="paper quote">This book takes knowledge from decades of magazines to bring the reader unique and fashionable knits, making it an excellent title for a core collection.</p>
            <h5>Ebooks:</h5>

This book is not for beginner knitters but for advanced knitters looking for the extra challenge of Japanese knitting.</p>
            <p class="paper quote">This is a well-reviewed book that showcases Japanese knitting. WPL should obtain the ebook through Overdrive with one copy one user style for $16.95 – the same cost as the trade paperback version. Users will be able to zoom in on complex patterns and the ebook will not become worn.</p>
