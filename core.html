        <p class="paper">The knitting collection at the Wasilla Public Library is being revamped following the start of a knitting club that meets at the library once a month. The mission statement from the Wasilla Public Library website is:</p>
        <p class="quote" class="paper">Set in the beautiful Matanuska-Susitna Valley, Wasilla Public Library is open to residents and visitors alike. The library contributes to building a sense of community and provides opportunities for improving quality of life by providing access to a broad range of resources designed to meet the educational, professional, intellectual, cultural and recreational needs of the area's diverse, rapidly growing population.</p>
        <p class="paper">The new knitting collection will meet the recreational and professional needs of the local community by providing them with resources. The patrons will gain access to instructional books, magazines, and a plethora of videos from Craftsy.com. The cost breakdown follows in Table 1.</p>
